\section{Statement of the Problem}

Waste management plays a crucial role in environmental sustainability, it involves the collection, processing, recycling, and disposal of waste materials. A key factor that makes the waste management process more effective is waste segregation. Waste segregation is the process of sorting waste into categories like recyclable, biodegradable, and non-recyclable materials to improve recycling efficiency and reduce landfill impact. The increasing volume of improperly segregated waste has a significant impact on pollution, health, and environmental damage. By utilizing technology and modernization, the problem of improper waste segregation can be solved.

The traditional approach of waste segregation involves manual sorting that depends on people’s knowledge which often leads to error, inefficiency, and unreliability. This study addresses the problem of the lack of a reliable and efficient waste segregation tool that assists users in segregating waste more accurately. Specifically, this study aims to develop a mobile application that utilizes image recognition and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify and sort waste into their proper categories.

By offering a user-friendly and accessible method for waste segregation, the mobile application aims to contribute to improved waste management practices, enhancing environmental sustainability and educating users as well on proper waste disposal methods.
